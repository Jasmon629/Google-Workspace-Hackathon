Problem Statement 

The travel industry is rapidly evolving, with an increasing number of travellers seeking personalized and immediate assistance for their travel plans. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the travel agency sector often struggle to compete with larger companies that have extensive resources to offer 24/7 customer service and personalized travel recommendations. Traditional methods of customer service, including phone and email support, are no longer sufficient to meet the growing expectations of customers for instant and accurate travel information. While the AI-powered chatbot can provide travel recommendations, users also often struggle with manually adding these recommendations to their calendars, leading to missed appointments and disorganized schedules. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors, diminishing the overall user experience. Hence, there is a need for a scalable solution that can provide timely, relevant, and customized travel advice to customers, enhancing their overall travel experience while reducing the operational burden on the agency.  

 

Scopes 

Develop and integrate an AI chatbot using the Gemini API for real-time customer interactions on the agency's website and seamlessly integrates selected trips into the user's Google Calendar. 

Provide personalized travel recommendations, including accommodations, destinations, dining options, and transportation. 

Design a user-friendly interface that handles multiple queries and maintains conversation context. 

 

Objectives 

To enhance customer service by offering 24/7 support and accurate travel information, thereby improving response time and satisfaction. 

To boost user engagement and conversions through personalized recommendations and real-time assistance.

To streamline operations by automating routine tasks, reducing operational costs, and allowing staff to focus on complex queries.
